# Cat Project!

To run this, clone the project and run the html file in any browser.

You can select to view all types of cats or filter by a specific breed.

Clicking on a cat will display a larger image and show the breed specific data and metadata about the image. 

Note: most images do not have breed specific data unless you filter by the breed.
